Project Documentation Review and Enhancement Task

Objective: Conduct a comprehensive review of our project documentation and codebase to identify gaps, inaccuracies, and improvement opportunities. Update documentation to accurately reflect current implementation and future requirements.

Instructions:

First, execute all tasks specified in @plan/phase1 (if applicable).

Documentation Analysis Phase:

Read all .md files throughout the project repository

For each document, analyze and note:

✅ Current coverage - What is well-documented?

⚠️ Gaps & missing information - What should be documented but isn't?

🔄 Outdated content - What references old/non-existent functionality?

📈 Improvement opportunities - Where could clarity, structure, or examples be added?

🎯 Implementation requirements - What documentation needs to be written for planned features?

Codebase Analysis Phase:

Review the actual code implementation

Compare code with existing documentation to identify discrepancies

Note undocumented features, parameters, or behaviors

Identify complex code sections that need additional documentation

Documentation Update Phase:

Create/update documentation based on your analysis:

Update existing .md files with corrections and additions

Create new documents for missing coverage areas

Ensure consistent formatting and structure across all docs

Add code examples where helpful

Include TODO markers for future implementation notes

Deliverables:

Updated .md files

A summary report of changes made

A prioritized list of remaining documentation gaps

Recommendations for code changes if documentation reveals implementation issues
