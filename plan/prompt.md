Project Documentation, Code Review & Full-Stack Enhancement Task

OBJECTIVE
Conduct a comprehensive review and enhancement of the project’s documentation, backend, and frontend codebase to ensure alignment between documentation and actual implementation. This task includes mandatory backend and frontend development changes when gaps are identified.

PHASE 0 – PRECONDITION
Complete and validate all tasks in plan/phase1. Any skipped task must include justification.

PHASE 1 – DOCUMENT PRIORITIZATION
Tier 1 (Critical):
- README.md
- requirements.md
- techstack.md
- codebase / architecture docs
- instructions.md
- implementation-plan.md

Tier 2 (Execution & Tracking):
- progress.md
- checklist.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- completion-report.md
- task-completion-report.md
- implementation-summary.md

Tier 3 (Review & Quality):
- documentation analysis and review reports
- prioritized documentation gaps

Tier 4 (Planning & Future):
- proposal.md
- phase2-tasks.md
- service interfaces plan
- controller refactoring plan

PHASE 2 – DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS
For each document:
- Current Coverage
- Gaps & Missing Info
- Outdated Content
- Improvement Opportunities
- Implementation Requirements (Backend / Frontend / Full-stack)

PHASE 3 – CODEBASE ANALYSIS
Backend:
- APIs, services, validation, database models

Frontend:
- UI components, API integration, UX flows

PHASE 4 – DEVELOPMENT CHANGES
Backend and frontend changes must be implemented when documentation gaps are found.

PHASE 5 – DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
Update existing docs, create missing docs, ensure consistent formatting, and include TODO markers.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated documentation
- Backend and frontend code changes
- Summary report
- Prioritized gap list
- Engineering recommendations
