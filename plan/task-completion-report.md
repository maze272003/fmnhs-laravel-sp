## Remaining Documentation Gaps

### High Priority (From prioritized-documentation-gaps.md)

1. **⏳ Service Implementation Documentation**
   - Status: Interfaces documented, need detailed method-level documentation
   - Effort: 6-8 hours
   - Priority: High
   - Required: Method-by-method business rules, usage examples, error handling patterns

2. **⏳ Developer Onboarding Guide**
   - Status: Not started
   - Effort: 4-6 hours
   - Priority: High
   - Required: Quick start guide, prerequisites, "Hello World" example

3. **⏳ Testing Strategy Documentation**
   - Status: Not started
   - Effort: 4-6 hours
   - Priority: High

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

3. **Document Service Implementation Details** (High Priority)
   - Add detailed method-by-method documentation for all 8 services
   - Document business rules and validation
   - Add usage examples

4. **Create Form Request Documentation**
   - Document the 14 form request classes identified
   - Create templates and validation examples

### Medium-term (After Controller Refactoring)

5. **Create Testing Strategy Documentation**
   - Document testing guidelines and standards
   - Add mock patterns and coverage requirements

6. **Create API Documentation**
   - Catalog all API endpoints
   - Document request/response schemas
